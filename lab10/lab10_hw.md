## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above. For any included plots, make sure they are clearly labeled. You are free to use any plot type that you feel best communicates the results of your analysis.  

Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!

## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "surveys_complete.csv"))
```

```
## 
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   record_id = col_double(),
##   month = col_double(),
##   day = col_double(),
##   year = col_double(),
##   plot_id = col_double(),
##   species_id = col_character(),
##   sex = col_character(),
##   hindfoot_length = col_double(),
##   weight = col_double(),
##   genus = col_character(),
##   species = col_character(),
##   taxa = col_character(),
##   plot_type = col_character()
## )
```

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?  

```r

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?


```r
deserts %>% 
  count(species, sort =T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 x 2
##    species          n
##    <chr>        <int>
##  1 merriami     10596
##  2 penicillatus  3123
##  3 ordii         3027
##  4 baileyi       2891
##  5 megalotis     2609
##  6 spectabilis   2504
##  7 torridus      2249
##  8 flavus        1597
##  9 eremicus      1299
## 10 albigula      1252
## # … with 30 more rows
```

```r
deserts %>% 
  count(genus, sort = T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 x 2
##    genus                n
##    <chr>            <int>
##  1 Dipodomys        16167
##  2 Chaetodipus       6029
##  3 Onychomys         3267
##  4 Reithrodontomys   2694
##  5 Peromyscus        2234
##  6 Perognathus       1629
##  7 Neotoma           1252
##  8 Ammospermophilus   437
##  9 Amphispiza         303
## 10 Spermophilus       249
## # … with 16 more rows
```

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.

```r
deserts %>% 
  tabyl(taxa)
```

```
##     taxa     n      percent
##     Bird   450 0.0129362387
##   Rabbit    75 0.0021560398
##  Reptile    14 0.0004024608
##   Rodent 34247 0.9845052607
```

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxa))+ geom_bar()+scale_y_log10()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxa, fill = plot_type)) + geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + scale_y_log10()+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxa",
       x = "Taxa",
       fill = "Plot Type")
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.

```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(weight!= "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(species,weight), y=weight))+geom_boxplot()+scale_y_log10()+coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "Observation of Weight by Species", x= "Species", y="Weight")
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

6. Add another layer to your answer from #5 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.

```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(weight!= "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(species,weight), y=weight))+geom_boxplot()+scale_y_log10()+geom_point(size=0.15)+coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "Observation of Weight by Species", x= "Species", y="Weight")
```

7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?

```r
deserts %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count("merriami")
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 x 3
## # Groups:   year [26]
##     year `"merriami"`     n
##    <dbl> <chr>        <int>
##  1  1977 merriami       487
##  2  1978 merriami       992
##  3  1979 merriami       658
##  4  1980 merriami      1375
##  5  1981 merriami      1417
##  6  1982 merriami      1964
##  7  1983 merriami      1652
##  8  1984 merriami       951
##  9  1985 merriami      1416
## 10  1986 merriami       922
## # … with 16 more rows
```


8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.

## I don't think there is a relationship between weight and hindfoot length considering the data does not follow the regression line. I don't this the factor of overplotting made much of a difference. 

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+geom_jitter()+geom_smooth(method = lm, se=F)
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.

```r
deserts %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  filter(weight!= "NA") %>% 
  summarise(avg_weight=mean(weight)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_weight))
```

```
## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```
## # A tibble: 22 x 2
##    species      avg_weight
##    <chr>             <dbl>
##  1 albigula          159. 
##  2 spectabilis       120. 
##  3 spilosoma          93.5
##  4 hispidus           65.6
##  5 fulviventer        58.9
##  6 ochrognathus       55.4
##  7 ordii              48.9
##  8 merriami           43.2
##  9 baileyi            31.7
## 10 leucogaster        31.6
## # … with 12 more rows
```


10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, fill = sex)) + geom_bar(na.rm = T) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Weight of Samples", x= "Weight", y="Count")
```
